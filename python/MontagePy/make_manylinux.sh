# This script is specifit to building the 'manylinux' wheels
# on a Centos05 platform (in our case under Docker).  Things
# like python2/python3 and auditwheel are already installed
# in the Docker image we ae using.
#
# In the Docker container, Python 2.7 is installed in
#
#    /opt/python/cp27-cp27m/bin
#
# and Python 3.6 is installed in
#
#    /opt/python/cp36-cp36m/bin
#
# Both have 'python' and 'pip', only 3.6 has 'auditwheel'.
# To avoid confusion, we'll use full paths here.
