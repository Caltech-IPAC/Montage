These files are for builds a set of Python wheels for multiple target systems using cibuildwheels (and, in the case of Linux) a standard 'manylinux' Docker container.  While kept here, it doesn't use this copy of Montage but rather draws a new one from the Montage development branch on GitHub.

So the best idea is to copy just this directory to a separate place on build machine and run this 'make.sh' there.
