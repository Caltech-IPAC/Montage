Montage (http://montage.ipac.caltech.edu) is an Open Source toolkit,
distributed with a BSD 3-clause license, for assembling Flexible 
Image Transport System (FITS) images into mosaics according to 
the user's custom specifications of coordinates, projection,
spatial sampling and rotation.

The toolkit contains utilities for reprojecting and background 
matching images, assembling them into mosaics, visualizing the
results, and discovering, analyzing and understanding image metadata
from archives or the user's images.

Montage is written in ANSI-C and is portable across all common
Unix-like platforms, including Linux, Solaris, Mac OSX and Cygwin on
Windows.  The package provides both stand-alone executables and
the same functionality in library form.  It has been cross-compiled
to provide native Windows executables and packaged as a binary Python
extension (available via "pip install MontagePy").

The distribution contains all libraries needed to build the toolkit 
from a single simple "make" command, including CFITSIO and the WCS
library (which has been extended to support HEALPix and World-Wide
Telescope TOAST projections. The toolkit is in wide use in astronomy
to support research projects, and to support pipeline development,
product generation and image visualization for major projects and
missions; e.g. Spitzer Space Telescope, Herschel, Kepler, AKARI and
others. Montage is used as an exemplar application by the computer
science community in developing next-generation cyberinfrastructure,
especially workflow frameworks on distributed platforms, including
multiple clouds.

Montage provides multiple reprojection algorithms optimized for 
different needs, maximizing alternately flux conservation, range of
projections, and speed.

The visualization module supports full (three-color) display of FITS
images and publication quality overlays of catalogs (scaled symbols),
image metadata, and coordinate grids.  It fits in equally well in
pipelines or as the basis for interactive image exploration and there
is Python support for the latter (It has also been used in web/Javascript
applications).

We are in the process of adding automated regression testing using Jenkins.
At the moment, this only includes a couple of dummy tests on a Jenkins server 
that we maintain specifically for the Montage project).

Montage was funded from 2002 to 2005 by the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration's Earth Science Technology Office, Computation
Technologies Project, under Cooperative Agreement Number NCC5-626
between NASA and the California Institute of Technology. The Montage
distribution includes an adaptation of the MOPEX algorithm developed
at the Spitzer Science Center. Montage is now funded by the National
Science Foundation under Award Number NSF ACI-1440620.
