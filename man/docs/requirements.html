<h1>System Requirements</h1>

<h2>Platform:</h2>
<p>Montage v4.0 has been tested with Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server
5.9 and Mac OS X 10.9.x, both with with gcc compiler Version 4.1.2.
The Montage code is ANSI-compliant, and is expected to build on all
*nix platforms and gcc compiler versions. Previous versions of Montage
have indeed built successfully on a wide range of platforms. There
have been occasional examples of platform-specific issues, usually
relating to tighter tolerances on, e.g,  datatypes and function
return types. Please contact us if you find such issues.</p>

<h2>Disk Space:</h2>
<p>The Montage distribution is 1.5 GByte in size (1.1 GByte GitHub ZIP file).
Of this, 31 MByte is source code; 1.1 GByte is documentation and
test data files The compiled binaries will occupy 201 MBytes. We are investigating
whether to release a more compact version with source code only.</p>

<h2>Compiler:</h2>
<p>By default, the Makefiles used by Montage call the standard
<span class="file">gcc</span> compiler (or whatever the command
"gcc" is aliased to).  </p>



<h2>Montage Memory Requirements</h2>

<p><a href="mAdd.html"><tt>mAdd</tt></a> builds the output mosaic
one row of pixels at a time.  Every input image that contributes
pixels to the "current" output row is opened, and the values from the
corresponding input row of pixels is read into memory.  Each pixel
value is preserved in memory until all input pixels have been recorded
and are ready to be averaged.  Although not as limited as previous
versions of Montage (which also held the entire output image array
in memory), this version therefore requires enough memory to store:

<ul>
  <li>One row of the output data image
  <li>One row of the output area image
  <li>One row of <i>each</i> input data image that overlaps the output row
  <li>One row of <i>each</i> input area image that overlaps the output row
</ul>



<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Montage Disk Space Requirements</h2>


<p>Montage  requires that all of the input images are on a local
disk and writes the output mosaic to the local disk.  The <span
class="file">mProject</span> module generates two intermediate
files for each input image, one containing the image flux
densities reprojected to the coordinate system and projection
of the output mosaic and one containing the corresponding
pixel area information.  Intermediate files are also created
by <a href="mDiff.html"><tt>mDiff</tt></a>, which creates a
difference image for each overlap region between neighboring
pairs of input images.  The total size of these difference
images is about equal to the total size of the intermediate
images created by <a href="mProject.html"><tt>mProject</tt></a>.
The <a href="mBackground.html"><tt>mBackground</tt></a> module
also generates an image and area file for each input image and the
<a href="mAdd.html"><tt>mAdd</tt></a> module generates the output
mosaic and a corresponding area coverage file. </p>

<p>To preserve astrometric and photometric accuracy, the intermediate
images, the output mosaic, and all area files are written as double
precision floating point -- 8 bytes per pixel -- regardless of
the data type of the input image pixels.  The number of pixels in
the intermediate images depends on both the input image and output
mosaic parameters.  A coordinate system transformation from input
space to output space is a rotation transformation.  For a square
image, the area of the bounding box around a 45 degree rotated image
is double the original image area (the area will be larger for a
long, thin image).  Therefore, ignoring projection distortion, a
"typical" intermediate reprojected image will have between <i>r</i>
and <i>2r</i> times the number of pixels in its corresponding input
image, where <i>r</i> is the ratio of the input image pixel size to
the output mosaic pixel size.  To be conservative users should have
total disk space, <i>D</i>, of:</p>

<blockquote><font size="+1"><tt>D = D<sub>in</sub> + D<sub>tmp</sub> + D<sub>out</sub></tt>,</font></blockquote>

<p>where <i>D<sub>in</sub></i> is the space in bytes required for the
input images, <i>D<sub>tmp</sub></i> is the space for the intermediate
images and area files, and <i>D<sub>out</sub></i> is the space for
the output mosaic.</p>

<blockquote><font size="+1"><tt>D<sub>in</sub> = N * P<sub>i</sub> * B<sub>i</sub></tt>, </font></blockquote>

<p>where <i>N</i> is the number of input images, <i>P<sub>i</sub></i>
is the number of pixels per image, and <i>B<sub>i</sub></i> is the
number of bytes per pixel.</p>

<blockquote><font size="+1"><tt>D<sub>tmp</sub> = 8 * (2 * r * N) * P<sub>i</sub> * B<sub>tmp</sub><br>
D<sub>tmp</sub> = 16 * r * N * P<sub>i</sub> * B<sub>tmp</sub></tt>,</font></blockquote>

<p>where <i>r</i> is the ratio of the input image pixel size to the
output mosaic pixel size, and <i>B<sub>tmp</sub></i> is the number
of bytes per pixel in the intermediate images (<i>B<sub>tmp</sub></i>
= 8 in Montage release 1.x).</p>

<blockquote><font size="+1"><tt>D<sub>out</sub> = P<sub>o</sub> * B<sub>o</sub></tt>,</font></blockquote>

<p>where <i>P<sub>o</sub></i> is the number of pixels in the output
mosaic and <i>B<sub>o</sub></i> is the number of bytes per pixel
in the output mosaic (<i>B<sub>o</sub></i> = 8 in Montage release
1.x).</p>

<p>Combining the above equations yields:</p>

<center>
<table border="1" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0">
<tr>
<td>
  <font size="+1"><tt>D = N * P<sub>i</sub> * (B<sub>i</sub> + 128 * r) + 16 * P<sub>o</sub></tt></font>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</center>



<p>where <i>N</i> is the number of input images, <i>P<sub>i</sub></i>
is the number of pixels per input image, <i>P<sub>o</sub></i> is
the number of pixels in the output mosaic, <i>B<sub>i</sub></i>
is the bytes per pixel in the input images, and <i>r</i> is the
ratio of the input image pixel size to the output mosaic pixel size
