<h1>Extending Montage to Larger or Different Problems</h1>

<p>The algorithms employed by Montage do not themselves limit the size of
either the input images or output mosaics.  The main limiting factor
to the problem size on which Montage can be applied is a hardware
limitation of the amount of disk space available (see <a href="requirements.html">Montage Memory
Requirements</a>).  If problems occur due to the size of the output image, we recommend that instead of constructing a
single huge output mosaic, users should build a set of output mosaic
tiles of more modest size that can simply be abutted together to form
the desired image region.  Users may prefer to leave the output as
this set of tiles because they may encounter more problems anyway if
they try to use their favorite FITS viewer to view the huge output
mosaic.</p>

<p>Montage uses the WCS library for reprojection and uses a general
mosaicking algorithm that should be suitable for creating mosaics in
any WCS projection, as long as the input images have valid FITS
headers with full WCS information.
