<h1> Montage Viewer:  Overlay Basics</h1>

mViewer has built-in functionality to draw overlays on the image.  So far these include
the following:</p>

<ul>
   <li> Coordinate grids </li>
   <li> Astronomical source (catalog) scaled symbols </li>
   <li> Image metadata (outlines) </li>
   <li> Markers (individual symbols) </li>
   <li> Labels</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Coordinate Systems, Colors and Symbols</b></p>

<p>In addition to the above there are state directives for color specification,
coordinate system and symbol reference size/shape). There can be multiple instance of each
overlay type and the state directives are "sticky".  For instance, if you set the color,
that color applies to all subsequent overlay directives on the command line until another
color is specified.  The coordinate system directive applies to all the overlays except "<tt>-grid</tt>",
where there are specific arguments for this (which don't stick).</p>

<p> All the lines, symbols, and text are drawn / typeset anti-aliased and for labelled curves
(<i>e.g.,</i> latitude lines) the text follows the curve of the line.  In a few situations 
some labels get twisted a little too fast and become hard to read but this is very rare.</p>

<p>Colors can be specified in standard HTML hex notation (<i>e.g.,</i> "<tt>f1a3e7</tt>") 
(see, for instance,  <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_colors.asp">
http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_colors.asp</a>) or by a few names for convenience 
(black, white, red, green, blue, magenta, cyan, yellow, gray).
A note on hex encoding:  since people are so used to it from HTML, we allow a leading pound sign 
(<i>e.g.,</i> "<tt>-color #a02ce8</tt>"). However, if put in scripts for shells based on <b>sh</b>
the pound can be taken as the beginning of a comment block.  So either avoid the pound, use a
non-sh shell, or put the argument in quotes.</p>

<p>The coordinate system can be Equatorial, Galactic, or Ecliptic (in fact the code just matches
the first two characters case insensitive so "ga" is adequate).  Where appropriate, the system
can be followed by epoch/equinox information (B/J for Besselian/Julian and a year).  Of course
this only applies to Equatorial and Ecliptic since Galactic does not precess.</p>

<p>The symbol directive sets the reference size for symbols and their shape.  The size can be
one of three variants:  a relative size (based on a fraction of the plot height)[default], in
arcseconds, arcminutes, or degrees (denoted by a 's', 'm', or 'd' suffix), or in pixels (a 'p' 
suffix).</p>

<img align="right" src="images/symbols.png" style="margin: 20px;"/>

<p>Symbol drawing can be a little confusing. The text below describes the symbol syntax but
it is often easier to absorb through examples.  See: <a href="mViewer_cookbookSymbols.html">
Montage Cookbook: Symbols</a></p>

<p>The symbol shape can be one of a pre-defined set:  triangle, box/square, diamond, pentagon, 
hexagon, septagon, octagon, el (an right angle between two line segments), circle or compass.  
The el and compass symbols are usually used as stand-alone "compass rose" markers.</p>

<p>Alternatively, the shape can be a user-defined shape of which there are three types: a simple
N-sided 'polygon', a 'starred' polygon (2N vertices with every other on a half radius), or a 
'skeletal' polygon (N points connected to the center by radial lines). This mode requires two 
parameters in addition to the symbol size: the type and the value of N. Optionally, you can also
give a rotation angle for any symbol. So "-symbol 2.0s polygon 3" is a triangle with one vertex 
pointing straight up and "-symbol 2.0s polygon 3 90." is the same triangle but with a vertex 
pointing to the right.</p>

<p>In the example on the right, we have three symbols, each with five "sides".  The top one is
a simple five-sided polygon, one arcminute in radius ("<tt>1m polygon 5</tt>").  The middle one
is "starred" and 30 arcseconds in radius ("<tt>30s starred 5</tt>") and the bottome one is 
"skeletal" and fifteen arcseconds in radius ("<tt>15s skeletal 5</tt>").</p>


<p>Example state directives:</p>

<p><pre>

   -csys Equatorial B1950
   -csys ga
   -color red
   -color ff00ff
   -symbol 2.0 circle
   -symbol 15p starred 5 36.


</pre></p>

<p> Each of the overlay directives has additional parameters.  Here are examples for the 
non-table overlays:</p>

<p>mViewer uses a general font mechanism but at this point only has one font loaded, so all the
labelling needs to give are the coordinates and text string.</p>

<p><b>About Fonts</b> mViewer uses the FreeType library and the FreeSans.ttf font 
file.  This includes regular Latin and Greek characters (as well as Japanese
Kana, <i>etc.</i>)  The FreeType library is comfortable with any TrueType font file, 
so swapping in an alternative one is straightforward.<p>

<p>The input to the library is Unicode, which many of todays applications (like editors)
can handle directly.  The details are application-specific, but if you can get special
characters into the mViewer command (script files are a good way), mViewer will render
them, <i>e.g.,</i></p>
