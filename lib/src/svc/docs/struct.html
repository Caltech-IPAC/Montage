<h2>              Structure Format
</h2>
</center>
<p>

This document explains the genesis of the format for return structures 
from ISIS services.<p>

There are several things we want from a structure definition:<p>

<ul>
<li> The structure should be self-defining; names for parameters and
     their values should both be included and easily associated.</li>
<li> Like a C structure, we want to allow nesting of information.</li>
<li> It should be open-ended; adding information shouldn't corrupt
     the structure and ordering (except for ordered arrays of data)
     shouldn't matter.</li>
<li> It should be easily parsible by software and specific items
     should be extractable without requiring full-depth parsing.</li>
<li> It should be readable (ASCII) text to allow for easy debugging
     of applications.</li>
</ul><p>

<hr><p>

We will start with a C structure definition as our template.  The example
below might arise if we are returning a list of coordinates for objects
in a region of the sky:<p>

<pre>
   struct
   {
      char name[20];

      int count;

      struct 
      {
	 double lon;
	 double lat;
	 char   csys[10];
      }
	 coords[256];
   }
</pre><p>

<hr><p>

But that's only the structure definition.  In addition we need the 
initialization structure that will populate it:<p>

<pre>
   {
      "My region",
      3,
      {
	 {321.34443, 34.45692, "eq"},
	 {321.35454, 34.87421, "eq"},
	 {321.34671, 34.54532, "eq"}
      }
   }
</pre><p>

<hr><p>

However, we want the names and values together.  In addition, since the
return structure is being sent between programs and even over the net,
and since we want the whole thing to be printable ASCII, there is not 
much point in carrying along type definitions.  So we can restructure
the above into the following:<p>

<pre>
   struct
   {
      name  = "My region";
      count = 3;

      struct 
      {
	 {
	    lon  = 321.34443;
	    lat  =  34.45692;
	    csys = "eq";
	 },

	 {
	    lon  = 321.35454;
	    lat  =  34.87421;
	    csys = "eq";
	 },

	 {
	    lon  = 321.34671;
	    lat  =  34.54532;
	    csys = "eq";
	 }
      }
	 coords;
   }
</pre><p>

<hr><p>

For parsibility, we need to be able to tell the difference between a
"structure" (where values are matched to names) and "arrays" (where the
data is ordered in a list.  For subtle (and not really compelling) reasons
we have also replaced semicolons with commas and braces with brackets:<p>

<pre>
   [struct
      name  = "My region",
      count = 3,

      coords =
      [array
	 [struct
	    lon  = 321.34443,
	    lat  =  34.45692,
	    csys = "eq",
	 ],

	 [struct
	    lon  = 321.35454,
	    lat  =  34.87421,
	    csys = "eq",
	 ],

	 [struct
	    lon  = 321.34671,
	    lat  =  34.54532,
	    csys = "eq",
	 ]
      ]
   ]
</pre><p>

<hr><p>

Since we aren't using this mechanism for bulk data transfer, we can string
it all together with no breaks (shown here on four lines but all one line
in the real output):<p>

<pre>
   [struct name   = "My region", count  = 3, coords = [array
   [struct lon  = 321.34443, lat  =  34.45692, csys = "eq"],
   [struct lon  = 321.35454, lat  =  34.87421, csys = "eq"],
   [struct lon  = 321.34671, lat  =  34.54532, csys = "eq"]]]
</pre><p>

<hr><p>

We could have compressed the format even further if we removed the duplicate
lon, lat, csys references.  However, leaving them in allows us to have                                                                       
arrays of unlike elements with equal ease:<p>

<pre>
   [struct name   = "My region", count  = 3, coords = [array
   [struct lon  = 321.34443, lat  =  34.45692, epoch="B1983.5"],
   [struct lon  = 321.35454, lat  =  34.87421, csys = "eq"],
   [struct file = "datalist.tbl", count = 347]]]]
</pre><p>

which could be used (in this case) to include special information (<i>e.g.</i>
epoch) or to say "there are 347 more coordinates in the file datalist.tbl").<p>
