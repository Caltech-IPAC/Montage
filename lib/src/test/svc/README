SVC/STRUCT Library Test Routines
--------------------------------

This directory contains three programs (test1, test2, and test3) which
use the svc library in slightly different ways.  'test1' (run using
test1.sh) reads input from a script and sends commands to agra (which
must be in the user's path).  'test2' does the same thing but is
hardwired (so doesn't need a script).  'test3' (run with test3.sh)
tests having multiple services in existence simultaneously.

The svc library needs another executable to drive.  For these test
it is assumed that the user has the program AGRA in their path.  On
most systems, this is the executable /irsa/isis/svc/bin/agra.

The directory also contains a test of the structure parsing routines
which are part of the svc library.  This program (structtest.c, run
using structtest.sh) reads a standard structure from stdin,
concatenating multiline input (used for readability) into a single
structure.  It then recursively decomposes the structure and writes
the results to stdout.  If there are additional lines in the input
stream (see test1.sh) it uses them as structure value references (for
svc_val()) and prints out the value for each one.

After the library in the parent directory (../libsvc.a) has been built,
"make clean" / "make" in this directory, then run test1.sh, test2.sh,
test3.sh, and structtest.sh.  Compare your output with test1.out,
test2.out, test3.out and structtest.out as a regression test.
